# Problem Statement
We are living in a digital world where people started approaching current technologies. They make our work easy and it's reliable.

Online payment is one of the scenarios that people started using in recent years. Just one click! One tap! makes our work easier and faster. As much as we know about the merits of online payment, some fraudsters try to loot money from people with different techniques.

With the increase in online payment nowadays, online payment fraud has also been rising and it's a major concern among the people who are not aware of the current technologies.

Let's analyze the online payment fraud detection dataset taken from Kaggle and provide insights on this!!

To identify online payment fraud with data analysis, we need to train for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud to understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which includes historical information about fraudulent transactions that can be used to detect fraud in online payments.
